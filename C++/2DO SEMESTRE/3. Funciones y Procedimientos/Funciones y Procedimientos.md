\# Functions and Procedures in C++

\## Description

This project demonstrates the use of \*\*functions and procedures in C++\*\* through a simple \*\*calculator program\*\*.  

The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can perform basic arithmetic operations.

&nbsp; - Addition.

&nbsp; - Subtraction.

&nbsp; - Multiplication.

&nbsp; - Division.

&nbsp; - Percentage calculation.

\- Menu-based navigation with input validation.

\- Interactive console input/output.
